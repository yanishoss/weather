## :rocket: Getting started
To get started, just install the project on your local machine:
```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yanishoss/weather

# Install the dependencies
yarn 
# or 
npm install
```

## :kiss: Coding style
How should you write your code ?
We use ![TypeScript][typescript] here, then you should know well ![TypeScript][typescript].
We use also the ES6 import statement over the require statement.

Try to use ES6 syntax as far as you can.
And that's all, for syntax issues, ![Prettier][prettier] will do the stuff for you!

## :pencil2: What should i do ?
There is a ![Trello board][trello] with all the stuff left to do, ![join it][invite]!

## How to use our ![Trello board][trello] ?
* Just ![join it][invite] first.
* Look at the tasks labeled in red, these are the tasks to do.
* When you start a task, label it with the *In progress* label.
* Put it in the *In progress* list.
* Do it.
* Label it with the *Done* label.
* Put it in the *Done* list.

## Make a Pull Request
* After picking out a task and right after doing it, you should fork this repository.
* After forking, push your code onto your forked repository.
* Make a Pull Request:
   * Put in the request the files changed or created.
   * Put why you changed these files or created these.
   * Put what ![Trello][trello] tasks you did.
   * Describe your changes.
   * Describe the feature or the API you introduced.
